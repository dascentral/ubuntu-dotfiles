## Uninstalling Software
Initially I thought I would create shell scrips to uninstall various software
packages from an Ubuntu server. I quickly realized that was probably a bad idea.

Instead, this folder contains various README files that contain information
I have collected from various Google searches over recent days, months, and years.

These files account for what I found in the moment so always good to check
the date modified on the file to ensure the information is still timely.
